Design of the Experiment 

The Lane Change Test (LCT) version 1.2 simulator was used in the experiment, simulating a vehicle’s most frequent driving conditions [1]. 
The experiment lasted approx. 80 min, divided into three phases:

  Baseline: The participant takes a seat and places the Emotiv EPOC sensor on their head [2]. The subject keeps their eyes closed and is acoustically isolated for 10 min, where the sensor is activated to collect information;
  
  First Task (Task_1): The participant starts driving the vehicle without any distraction. During driving, the EEG signals, ISA, and ER are collected. In the end, NASA-TLX is applied;
  
  Second task (Task_2): In order to increase the subject’s cognitive workload levels, the stress induction protocol proposed in [3] is applied as a second task. The task consists of the random mentioning of a series of digits that the participant has to repeat, following the order of the set of numbers given. All measurements are collected.
